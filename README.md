# Popuation-Simulation
This is a project for my modelling and simulation class whose question was to calculate how many people will there be in the year 2050 and to model a projection of the world population growth from 2011 to year 2070. 
To run this program simpling run the UI.py file, make sure all the scripts are in the same folder also.
